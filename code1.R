#Cuberoot problem

# problem is 
# take a number betweeen 1 to 10

# mutliply the number by itself
# mutilply by 5
# multiply by 2
# again mutliply the number by itself
# add 5
# add 2

#*n * n * 5 * 2 * n + 5 + 2

#n^3 * 10 + 7

number =  value ^3 / 10 - 7

value <- 64

value^(1/3)

3^3

27^(1/3)


#write function
